# React Native One

one to rule them all!

React Native One is a demo project I created after making number of react native projects in the past. I have realized that I made some horrible mistakes in the past and hope to create a template project that will address most of the issue in this project.

### What React Native One will do better this time?

- [x] Better style management
- Better way to seperating components and importing them
- More cross platform ready
- Better localization
- Better native module management
- Better state management and persistence
- First run setup support
- Permission management
- Animation manager
- Platform based style and layout
- Mabe a layout engine?
